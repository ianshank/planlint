    Matched against the directory LISTING rather than by probing

    leg found the hard way:

    1. On a case-insensitive filesystem, probing `makefile` succeeds against a
       file written `Makefile`, and the returned path then carries the
       *candidate's* spelling rather than the real one. `detect` can shrug that
       off -- its dialect card carries targets, never the filename -- but this
       function's result is a scanned path that a caller reports on, so the
       wrong spelling is user-visible. The listing gives the true name.
    2. Presence, not readability, is what ends the search. `make` stops at the
       first name that EXISTS, even if it cannot open it, so a directory named
       `GNUmakefile` must not let a lower-precedence `Makefile` be scanned --
       that would report on a file `make` would never read. Readability is the
       caller's problem, which is why ``check_makefile`` tolerates a path it
       cannot open rather than this function silently skipping it.

    the key would match the same name under any other table.

    The path is an argument rather than :func:`repo_root`, deliberately. The
    coverage gates read the ``pyproject.toml`` of whichever tree they are
    pointed at, so they can be exercised against a synthetic one (see
    ``tests/test_ci_hardening.py``, which writes a floor of 95 into a temp
