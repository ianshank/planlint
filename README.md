# planlint

**The CI gate that fails when a spec cites a gate this repo does not have.**

**In plain English:** software teams often write planning documents — this
project calls them "specs" — that describe what a feature should do, how
it'll be tested, and what percentage of the code needs to be covered by
tests. Those documents are supposed to match the real project, but nothing
stops them from drifting out of sync: a spec might reference a test command
that got renamed months ago, quote a coverage number the project no longer
enforces, or cite a design decision that was never actually written down.
`planlint` reads your project's real setup — its actual test commands, its
actual coverage settings, its actual decision records — and checks every
spec against those facts. If a spec claims something the project doesn't
actually back up, `planlint` fails the check, the same way a broken test
fails, catching the mismatch immediately instead of letting it mislead the
next person who reads the plan.

Point `planlint` at a cloned repository. It reads the target's *real* machinery —
its make targets, where its coverage floor actually lives, its invariant
source, which spec dialect it writes — then holds every spec to that, using the
target's own vocabulary rather than an imported one. A spec that cites
`make regression` in a repo with no `regression` target fails the build. A spec
that hard-codes `85%` when `pyproject.toml` gates `90%` fails the build. A plan
with no non-success criterion fails the build.

A spec convention written as guidance decays. The same convention expressed as a
linter with an exit code does not. `planlint` is a **linter under
`openspec validate`**, not an authoring framework.

It is also a **dependency graph for specs**: requirements link to the criteria
that verify them, criteria link to the make stage that runs them, invariants
link to the contract that declares them, ADRs link to the decision log that
declares them, thresholds link to the config that gates
them. `validate` fails when a link is broken — an orphan requirement, a
criterion that cites a stage the repo doesn't have, an invariant or ADR cited
but never declared, a threshold hard-coded instead of read from its source.

Zero runtime dependencies. Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install planlint                 # or `pip install -e .` for a dev checkout
planlint --target /path/to/clone detect      # read-only: stack, dialect, threshold
planlint --target /path/to/clone detect --format json   # portable dialect card (schema-versioned)
planlint --target /path/to/clone detect --diff prev.json  # exit 1 + list what drifted, else PASS
planlint --target /path/to/clone init        # write a snapshot of detected conventions into openspec/
planlint --target /path/to/clone new add-thing --capability thing-capability
planlint --target /path/to/clone validate    # exit 1 on any ERROR — the gate
planlint --target /path/to/clone waivers --format json  # ledger of every waived rule, tree-wide
planlint --target /path/to/clone graph --format mermaid  # a picture, not just JSON (see below)
planlint --version                           # print the installed version and exit
```

The distribution and the command are both `planlint`, with no hyphen.
`plan-lint` on PyPI is an unrelated project, analysing LLM agent plans; this
one gates OpenSpec and SpecKit change packages against a repository's real
machinery.

### Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | No findings at or above `--fail-on` |
| 1 | Findings were reported — a real spec failure |
| 2 | Precondition or usage error: no spec tree, an unknown `--change`, or a `--target` that is not a directory. **Not** a spec failure |

> **Changed in 0.2.0:** a `--target` that is not a directory now exits 2, not 1.
> CI that treats any nonzero code as failure is unaffected; anything that
> distinguished 1 from 2 should be re-read (`DEC-SD-001`). Two error message
> strings also changed — see the changelog.

> Contributors upgrading from before the distribution rename should run
> `pip uninstall openspec-graph` first. Two distributions providing the same
> import name make `--version`'s distribution lookup pick between them in
> undefined order, so a stale editable install can report the wrong version.

> The command was renamed from `specgraph` to `planlint`. `specgraph` remains a
> backwards-compatible alias that prints a deprecation to stderr and delegates
> (preserving the real exit code), so existing CI keeps working. The waiver
> comment syntax (`<!-- specgraph:allow ... -->`), the config file
> (`openspec/specgraph.json`), and the `[tool.specgraph]` pyproject section keep
> the `specgraph` name as stable contract identifiers.

## Why this and not Spec-Kit / GitHub Spec / Kiro / Cursor

The category is crowded with authoring surfaces. `planlint` is deliberately not
one. Rather than claim feature parity (or gaps) against tools we have not
audited line-by-line, here is the positioning that is actually load-bearing:

| Tool | Primary lane | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `planlint` | spec-as-lint in CI (under `openspec validate`) | CLI with an exit code; no UI, no MCP server |
| Spec-Kit | spec storyboarding / validation | CI |
| GitHub Spec | spec editing tied to GitHub | CI / IDE |
| Kiro | spec-driven IDE workflow | IDE |
| Cursor / Gemini CLI | AI coding agents | IDE / CLI |

What `planlint` does that the authoring surfaces do not, by construction:

- Reads the target repo's real machinery (Makefile, `pyproject.toml`, invariant
  source) and holds specs to *that*, using the target's own vocabulary.
- Reads thresholds from the detected locator instead of letting them be
  hard-coded in spec prose (G003).
- Fails closed when a spec cites a gate the repo does not have (G004).

What `planlint` deliberately does **not** do (see Non-goals): author specs, own a
UI, serve MCP, run tests, or carry dependencies.

The wedge is narrow on purpose: **`planlint` is the thing you point at someone
else's clone to prove its specs are executable in that repo.** The moment it
becomes a place people write specs, it enters a feature race with 60k-star tools
and loses.

## Why detection comes first

The two repositories this was built against disagree on nearly everything a
naive template would have hard-coded:

| | `Mango_Code_Agent-Harness` | `Mouse-Droid-AGI` |
|---|---|---|
| spec dialect | `harness` (`AC-<AREA>-<n>` + `_Verified by:_`) | `upstream` (`### Requirement:` + `#### Scenario:`) |
| coverage floor lives in | `harness/shared/governance-policy.json:coverage.lines` | `pyproject.toml:[tool.coverage.report].fail_under` |
| focused gate | `make test-governance` | `make regression` |
| invariants | 17 `INV-n` in `CONTRACT.md` | none declared |
| make targets | 29 | 18 |

A template that emitted `_Verified by: make test-governance` into Mouse-Droid
would produce a criterion nothing can run. `planlint` picks the stage from the
target's actual Makefile and cites the target's actual threshold locator, so
G003 and G004 below become enforceable rather than aspirational.

Detection is read-only by contract — `planlint detect` is always safe against an
unfamiliar clone.

## Non-goals (what this rejects)

- **Not an authoring framework.** No `propose`, `apply`, `chat`, or `generate`
  verb. The CLI surface is a closed set of read/lint verbs; a guard test
  (`tests/test_cli_surface.py`) fails if an authoring verb is added.
- **Not an IDE or a UI.** No editor integration, no dashboard. It is a CLI with
  an exit code, designed to live behind `openspec validate` in CI.
- **Not an MCP server.** It exposes no tools and runs no server. The Agent
  Skill below is prose an agent *reads* so it can invoke the CLI itself;
  there is no callable tool surface. It remains the gate those agents'
  output must pass.
- **Not a coverage tool.** It reads the coverage floor the repo already
  configures; it does not run tests or compute coverage.
- **No dependencies.** Stdlib only, so grafting into an arbitrary repo adds no
  supply-chain surface to the thing being governed.

## Rules

Prose conventions, mechanized. `ERROR` blocks the gate; `WARN` degrades review
quality without making the document wrong.

| ID | Sev | Dialect | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| G001 | ERROR | any | The spec declares something verifiable at all |
| G002 | ERROR | harness, upstream | At least one criterion names a **non-success** outcome |
| G003 | ERROR | any | No hard-coded thresholds; read them from the detected locator |
| G004 | ERROR | any | Every cited `make <target>` exists in the target's Makefile |
| G005 | WARN | any | Every cited `INV-n` is declared in the invariant source |
| G006 | WARN | any | Every declared invariant is cited by a living spec, or waived |
| G007 | ERROR | any | Every waiver (`specgraph:allow`) states a reason |
| G008 | WARN | any | Every cited `ADR-n` is declared in the ADR source |
| G009 | WARN | any | Every declared ADR is cited by a living spec, or waived |
| G010 | INFO | any | `make` citations are reported when no makefile was found, so a vacuous pass is legible |
| G011 | WARN | any | A cited generic stage (`ci`/`test`/`validate`/`lint`/`coverage`) exists, when the repo does use Make |
| H001 | ERROR | harness | Every AC has `_Verified by:_` naming a runnable stage |
| H002 | WARN | harness | Every AC traces to an `R-`/`C-` requirement |
| H003 | WARN | harness | No orphan requirements (every one is verified by some AC) |
| H004 | ERROR | harness | Criterion IDs are unique |
| H005 | WARN | harness | A `(BLOCKING)` open question keeps `Status: DRAFT` |
| H006 | WARN | harness | Required sections present |
| U001 | ERROR | upstream | An `ADDED`/`MODIFIED`/`REMOVED` delta header is declared |
| U002 | ERROR | upstream | Every requirement has at least one Scenario |
| U003 | ERROR | upstream | Every Scenario names a stimulus (`WHEN`) and an outcome (`THEN`); `GIVEN` is optional |
| U004 | WARN | upstream | Requirements use SHALL / MUST |
| U005 | WARN | upstream | Heading depths match the convention |
| S001 | ERROR | speckit | No unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker |
| S002 | ERROR | speckit | `FR-`/`SC-` identifiers are unique |
| S003 | WARN | speckit | Functional requirements use SHALL / MUST |
| S004 | WARN | speckit | Acceptance scenarios name a stimulus (`WHEN`) and an outcome (`THEN`) |
| W001 | ERROR | any | Every cited stage has a fresh, exit-0 witness (only under `--require-witness`) |
| W002 | ERROR | any | A witness's recorded coverage meets the detected floor (only under `--require-witness`) |

W001 and W002 are **opt-in**. A plain `validate` does not evaluate them, and a
passing run is not proof that any cited stage executed. `--require-witness`
reads content-addressed files under `.planlint/witnesses/`. This repository
gitignores `.planlint/`, and a typical CI checkout does the same, so enabling
the flag on a fresh clone **always fails closed** (W001: never witnessed).
Record witnesses in the job that actually ran the stage, and persist the
store as an artifact if a later job needs it. The composite Action does not
expose `--require-witness` for that reason.

A target with **no Makefile and no coverage floor** is a related honesty
gap: G003 and G004 have nothing to compare citations against, so a green
`validate` proves less than it looks like it proves. The Action reports that
through `discovery-warnings` and a warning annotation rather than relabelling
the run `indeterminate`. Widening that status is a policy change, not a
projection change.

G002 is the load-bearing one: *at least one criterion must name a non-success
outcome — what this change rejects, denies, or fails closed on.* A plan that
only describes success has not said what going wrong looks like. See
`tests/fixtures/good_harness.md` and `tests/fixtures/good_upstream.md` for a
non-success criterion demonstrated in each dialect.

G003 is the second. Thresholds are a governance input, not a spec literal; a
number typed into a criterion is a number that will drift from the config that
actually gates CI.

### Waivers

Judgement calls stay possible, but stay visible:

```markdown
<!-- specgraph:allow G003 this spec's subject IS the 85% hook floor -->
```

The finding is downgraded to `INFO` and prefixed `[waived]` — it still appears
in the report and in CI logs. It is not deleted. A waiver you cannot see is a
rule you no longer have. The `specgraph:allow` comment syntax is a stable
contract identifier kept under that name for backwards compatibility.

A waiver with no reason text fails the gate (`G007`) — a suppression is a
claim, and a claim with nothing behind it is not a judgement call.

`planlint waivers --format json` lists every waived rule across the whole
tree — rule, file, line, reason, and the owning change package — so a
suppression is discoverable without grepping every `spec.md` by hand:

```bash
planlint --target /path/to/clone waivers --format json
```

## What it found in a real repository

Run on 2026-08-30 with the pre-rename `openspec-graph` 0.1.0 against
`ianshank/Mouse-Droid-AGI` at `<sha>` (12 specs across 10 change packages),
`planlint validate --fail-on WARN` returned exit 1 with these genuine defects:

- `mouse-droid-nemoclaw-integration/specs/openclaw-integration/spec.md` states
  six requirements (`## REQ 1:` … `## REQ 6:`) and **zero** scenarios — nothing
  verifies any of them (G001, U002 ×6).
- `mouse-droid-doc-reconciliation/specs/docs-governance/spec.md` pins `85%` in
  criterion prose while the repo's real floor is `pyproject.toml` `fail_under =
  90` — exactly the drift G003 exists to catch.
- `mouse-droid-deploy-repin/specs/pin-reachability/spec.md` writes requirements
  at `##` and scenarios at `###`, while its nine sibling packages use `###` and
  `####` (U005), and declares no delta header (U001).
- Twelve requirements across `claude-workforce` and `dev-governance` are titled
  as nouns ("MCP Configuration", "Truthful Coverage Claims") with no SHALL or
  MUST, so they read as topics rather than obligations (U004). **Partly a
  linter bug** — see item 4 below for how many of these were real.

Against `Mango_Code_Agent-Harness` at `<sha>`: 0 errors, 4 warnings — every spec in
`add-neurosym-governed-synthesis` goes from `## Problem Statement` straight to
`## Acceptance Criteria` with no `## Requirements` section, so its ACs have
nothing to trace back to (H006).

### And what it got wrong

Four findings in the first run were the linter's fault, not the repo's. They
are now regression tests, named after the file that exposed them:

1. **G002 false positive** on `cloud-egress`. "a partial GCP block **opens no**
   egress channel" is a non-success scenario; the original fixed-phrase detector
   missed it. Replaced with a negation-pattern matcher covering absence
   phrasings (`opens no`, `mutates neither`, `leaves … unchanged`).
2. **Misleading G001** on `pin-reachability`. Reported "no criteria found" when
   the real problem was heading depth. The parser now accepts `##`–`####` for
   requirements and reports the deviation as U005 — blaming the drift, not the
   author.
3. **Unrecognized third form.** `## REQ 1:` parsed as nothing. Now recognized,
   so the report says "6 requirements but no Scenario" instead of silence.
4. **U004 body-blind check.** `Requirement.text` was populated from the
   heading line alone, so a heading with no SHALL/MUST but a normative
   sentence in the body below it — the common real-world authoring style —
   still false-fired U004. Some of the "twelve requirements… titled as
   nouns" above were this bug, not a genuine authoring gap; measured
   directly, 20 of 34 requirements across four change packages were
   affected. `Requirement` now carries the body text too, and U004 checks
   both.

A second round, run against twenty synthetic target repositories and a
hand-labelled sentence corpus instead of two real repos, found four more.
These are also regression tests now, under `tests/corpus/targets/` and
`tests/fixtures/phrasing/`:

5. **False G004 from a byte-order mark.** U+FEFF is a format character, not
   whitespace, so `str.strip()` left it on the first Makefile line and it
   became part of the first target's name. A valid repo whose Makefile
   started with a BOM was told it cited a target it did not have. Stripped in
   the parser and decoded away at the read site.
6. **Wrong threshold locator.** `fail_under` was matched under *any* TOML
   table and then reported as `[tool.coverage.report].fail_under`, a table
   that did not exist in the file. Now scoped to the table it names.
7. **Truncated floor.** `fail_under = 85.5` was read as `85`, which quietly
   loosens the gate being reported. Fractions survive; integers stay
   integers so saved dialect cards do not churn.
8. **G002 was switched off by ordinary prose.** The negation matcher scored
   precision 0.38 on a labelled set: bare `zero`, `block`, `fail` and
   `without` fired on "zero-downtime deploy", "the block renders", and
   "--cov-fail-under". Because G002 asks only whether *one* non-success
   criterion exists, a single false positive silenced the rule for the whole
   document. The matcher is now tiered (an author's `(non-success)` marker,
   then structural grammar, then anchored verb forms) and held to floors in
   `pyproject.toml`; measured precision 0.919 on a corpus half of whose
   negatives were written to trip the matcher. In the same pass U004's
   substring test, which read "shallow clone" as normative, became
   word-bounded.

A linter that never fails is a decoration; one that fails wrongly gets disabled.
Both directions are tested, and for the two rules that read prose the
false-positive rate is a tracked number rather than a hope.

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q     # full suite
make ci                         # test + lint + validate (core gate)
make pre-pr                     # full enterprise AQA gate
```

Every rule has a fixture that violates it and an assertion that the rule fires
on exactly that violation. Additionally: `test_scaffolded_spec_passes_its_own_validator`
generates a package in both dialects and validates it, so the templates cannot
drift from the rules; `test_apply_is_idempotent_and_refuses_to_clobber` proves a
hand-edited spec survives re-running `planlint new`.

The agent-facing surface is held to the same bar rather than trusted as prose.
`tests/test_skill_contract.py` proves every verb the skill calls read-only
leaves a target tree byte-identical, by hashing every file before and after
rather than reading `git status` (which is blind to ignored paths and useless
on a non-git target), and pins the exact exit-code messages the skill quotes.
`tests/test_agent_artifacts.py` validates the evaluation suite, the retrieval
config, and the release workflow, because those are read only by tools outside
this repo and would otherwise fail first in someone else's runner.

Two labelled corpora sit under the same gate: `tests/corpus/targets/` holds
synthetic target repositories with the dialect card a correct `detect` should
emit, and `tests/fixtures/phrasing/` holds hand-labelled sentences the G002 and
U004 matchers are scored against, with floors read from `pyproject.toml`. Both
run inside `make test`, which needs the dev extras (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`;
Hypothesis powers `tests/test_properties.py`).

## Enterprise AQA gate

`make pre-pr` runs the full quality bar in one command — the same bar CI
enforces:

| Gate | Command | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| test | `make test` | pytest + line & branch coverage (floors in `pyproject.toml`) |
| lint | `make lint` | ruff across package, tests, and tools |
| typecheck | `make typecheck` | mypy (config in `pyproject.toml`) |
| security | `make security` | gitleaks (or deterministic fallback) |
| validate | `make validate` | `planlint validate --fail-on ERROR` |
| e2e-live | `make e2e-live` | live no-mocks self-validation: installed CLI vs this repo, plus one pass under an ASCII-only console |
| thresholds | `make thresholds` | no hard-coded coverage floors or tool-version pins in the Makefile or any workflow |
| docs | `make docs-check` | required docs present + linked from README |

The mock-track gates (`test`/`lint`/`typecheck`) also run on `windows-latest`
(`test-windows`, Python 3.12), and the live track runs under an ASCII-only
console (`encoding-stress`), so the platform/encoding guard tests execute in
the environments they guard.

No numeric threshold lives in the Makefile or CI YAML — floors are read from
`pyproject.toml` at run time, and `tools/check_no_hardcoded_thresholds.py`
fails the gate if a number is re-introduced. Debug diagnostics go to stderr
only via `--verbose` / `PLANLINT_LOG_LEVEL` (the legacy `SPECGRAPH_LOG_LEVEL` is
still accepted); JSON stdout stays parseable. See [`docs/aqa.md`](docs/aqa.md).

## Wiring it into CI

One step. Copy [`templates/spec-gate.yml`](templates/spec-gate.yml) into
`.github/workflows/` and push:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  specs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: ianshank/planlint/.github/actions/planlint@a1b686864282e27c754ec1d49ac6f931e1e140e1
        with:
          target: "."
          fail-on: ERROR
```

The action installs the CLI from **its own checkout** when `version` is left
empty, so the `uses:` ref pins the adapter and the CLI together and there is
no package index to wait for. The composite steps are bash and the documented
runner is `ubuntu-latest`; Windows CI in this repository covers the pytest
suite, not this action.

`v0.2.0` is the first public tag and is **not on GitHub until the release
workflow cuts it**. Pin the commit SHA above until then. After the tag
exists, switch the ref to `@v0.2.0`. A full commit SHA remains valid either
way.

The action runs the gate once, annotates the pull request, writes a job
summary, and uploads the complete evidence bundle — the findings envelope,
its SARIF projection, the dialect card and the run metadata — as a workflow
artifact you can download on a red build. It needs no token and no secret:
it reads the repository and writes nothing into it, which is the posture a
fork pull request gets anyway.

**It reports four results, and only the first is green.**

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pass` | Specs were checked and nothing reached the threshold. |
| `fail` | Findings reached the threshold. The count is in `blocking`. |
| `indeterminate` | Nothing was checked. A spec tree exists and holds no change package, so the gate measured nothing — a green check here would be a lie. |
| `error` | The scan could not run: a bad target, or no spec tree at all. Not a spec failure. |

Every count, the triggered rule ids, the detected dialect and the evidence
paths are step outputs, so a workflow can branch on the result without scraping
a log. `make-targets` and `coverage-floor` report what the run had to check
against: a target with neither gives two of the rules nothing to compare, and
the action says so rather than letting the silence read as a pass.

**Narrowing the scan.** Two optional inputs pass a single named CLI flag
each; both default to empty, which omits the flag entirely.

| Input | Passes | Empty (the default) |
|---|---|---|
| `change` | `--change <name>` — lint one OpenSpec change package | the whole spec tree is checked |
| `dialect` | `--dialect <harness\|upstream\|speckit\|auto>` — override detection | the detected dialect is used |

```yaml
      - uses: ianshank/planlint/.github/actions/planlint@a1b686864282e27c754ec1d49ac6f931e1e140e1
        with:
          change: add-payment-retry
          dialect: speckit
```

Scoping with `change` narrows what the gate can see: the tree-wide rules
(`G006`, `G009`) cannot be answered from one package and report as skipped
`INFO` lines rather than passing. A scoped run is a useful fast signal on a
pull request, not a replacement for an unscoped gate.

There is deliberately **no `extra-args` input**: a raw pass-through would make
the whole CLI an undocumented public API. Each flag an adopter needs becomes
its own named input. `--require-witness` is deliberately absent — the witness
store is gitignored, so a fresh CI checkout always fails it closed. The
`dialect` *input* overrides detection; the `dialect` *output* still reports
what the scan actually detected.

Or run the CLI directly, without the action:

```yaml
      - run: pip install planlint
      - run: planlint --target . detect                       # surfaces drift in the log
      - run: planlint --target . validate --fail-on ERROR     # exit 1 blocks the merge
```

Or as a Make target, so it joins the existing gate ladder:

```make
specs: ## Validate every OpenSpec change package
	planlint --target . validate --fail-on ERROR
```

## Use from a coding agent

`planlint` ships as an Agent Skill so a coding agent can run the gate instead
of guessing at it. The skill states the verb surface, the exit-code contract,
and the boundary an agent must not cross — it never restates rule logic in
prose, and it never overrides a nonzero exit.

```
/plugin marketplace add ianshank/planlint
/plugin install planlint-spec-governance@planlint
```

The skill source is [`skills/planlint-spec-governance/SKILL.md`](skills/planlint-spec-governance/SKILL.md).
Its rule catalog is generated from the rule registry by `make skill-catalog`,
so it cannot drift from the engine. Agents that read the open Agent Skills
format can also use the directory directly by copying it into their own skills
folder; it carries no repository-relative references.

Evaluation cases live in [`evals/`](evals/README.md). The adversarial ones each
ask the agent to make a finding disappear without changing the fact behind it;
wherever that move leaves a trace in the commands run or the files changed, it
is graded on that trace rather than on what the agent said. They are the
evidence that the skill cannot be talked into a false pass.

The skill is deliberately allowed to repair an existing spec and re-run the
gate, and deliberately forbidden from making a finding disappear without
changing the fact behind it: no agent-written waivers, no recorded witnesses,
no edits to the coverage floor, no renamed Makefile targets.

## Dogfooding

This repo validates its own specs. The `openspec/` tree holds change packages
written in the `harness` dialect, and CI runs `planlint --target . validate
--fail-on ERROR` as a hard gate — if any spec in this repo violates a rule, the
build fails. The first change package, [`add-graph-export`](openspec/changes/add-graph-export/specs/graph-export/spec.md),
specs a `planlint graph` verb that emits the dependency graph as JSON; it
carries seven acceptance criteria, two of them non-success paths, and it
validates clean against the rules it will one day implement.

`graph --format mermaid` (see [`add-mermaid-graph-export`](openspec/changes/add-mermaid-graph-export/specs/mermaid-graph-export/spec.md))
renders the same graph as a Mermaid flowchart instead — GitHub/GitLab render
it inline, so a PR diff on `openspec/` can carry an actual picture, not just
JSON. `--format dot` stays rejected (`AC-GR-6`): Mermaid is text these hosts
render natively, a different thing from image rendering, which is what that
rejection protects against. `graph --change <name>` scopes the picture to one
change package.

## Design constraints

- **Detection never writes.** `detect` is safe on any clone.
- **Makefile parsing never executes.** Structural target detection
  (`machinery.py`) is text-only — it never shells out to `make`, at any
  confidence level, not even as a fallback. GNU Make evaluates `$(shell
  ...)` calls at parse time unconditionally, so no flag combination makes
  invoking a real `make` safe against an untrusted target repo's Makefile.
- **Scaffolding never clobbers.** Existing files are skipped unless `--force`;
  `--dry-run` prints the plan and writes nothing.
- **The target's vocabulary wins.** `planlint` adapts to the repo's dialect,
  stages, and threshold locator. It does not impose Mango's.
- **No dependencies.** Stdlib only, so grafting into an arbitrary repo adds no
  supply-chain surface to the thing being governed.

## Documentation

- [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) — releases and notable changes
- [Architecture (C4)](docs/architecture/c4.md) — context, container, component, code
- [AQA guide](docs/aqa.md) — the full quality bar and how to reproduce it
- [Hooks](docs/hooks.md) — pre-commit + CI gates, the `.claude/` Claude Code
  hooks/agents/skills dev-tooling layer, and how to add a rule
- [Agents, skills, and the harness](docs/agents-skills-harness.md) — why this is
  a deterministic governance harness, not an autonomous agent
- [Agent Skill](skills/planlint-spec-governance/SKILL.md) — the distributable
  skill a coding agent installs: verbs, exit codes, and the repair boundary
- [Agent entry point](AGENTS.md) — the pointer an agent loads on its own; it
  defers to the Agent Skill above rather than restating it
- [Evaluation suite](evals/README.md) — activation, repair and adversarial
  cases proving the skill refuses to make findings disappear
- [Eval corpus plan](docs/eval-corpus-plan.md) — the peer-reviewed plan behind
  the labelled corpora and property tests, and what was deferred and why
- [Next steps](docs/next-steps.md) — what is deliberately out of scope
- [Differentiation roadmap](docs/differentiation-roadmap.md) — the wedge, the
  comparison, and the candidate change packages
- [Distribution plan](docs/distribution-plan.md) — what remains between this
  repository and a published release, and what was deliberately cut
- [Peer review (2026-09)](docs/peer-review-2026-09.md) — what the gate
  actually checks when it says PASS, measured against built target
  repositories, and the rewritten remainder that follows from it
