"""A discovered spec that cannot be read is a precondition failure (exit 2),
never a finding (exit 1) and never a silent pass (exit 0) — `AC-RE-1..12`.

The defect these pin: `parse.parse_spec` read its bytes with no guard, so a
spec path that exists but cannot be opened (a permission-denied file, a
dangling mount, a directory where a file belongs) let an ``OSError`` escape to
the top of ``validate``/``waivers``/``graph``. That printed a traceback and
exited 1 — the code the contract reserves for "findings were reported at or
above --fail-on" — so a CI job could not tell a broken checkout from a failing
gate. Same defect class as ``DEC-SD-001`` (``init``/``new`` on an unwritable
target), one verb further in.

Every verb that parses specs is covered, not just ``validate``: the bug was in
the shared parse layer, so a test for one verb would have passed while the
other three stayed broken.
