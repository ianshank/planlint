"""Every install line this repository prints, held to what it actually ships.

The failure this exists for already happened: the project was renamed, the
distribution was renamed with it, and eight places kept printing an install
command for a name that no longer existed -- README, the skill's own preflight
step, and both copies of the CI template an adopter is told to paste into their
repository. Nothing failed, because nothing compares prose against packaging
metadata.

These are text checks, deliberately. A test cannot prove a distribution
resolves on a package index without network access, and a gate that needs the
network is a gate that fails on a plane. What it can prove is that every
install line spells the name this repository actually builds, that the version
floor an adopter is handed is the one the skill enforces, and that the changelog
links releases the way this project names them. Publication itself is a
release-time check (`.github/workflows/release.yml` installs the built wheel
into a clean environment), not a unit test.

Two design choices are load-bearing, because the first draft of this file got
both wrong and a review caught them:

*Files are discovered, not listed.* The incident was eight places drifting; a
hand-written tuple of the four that were fixed is a regression test for those
four, not a gate against a ninth. So the corpus is globbed.

*Every scan asserts its own subject exists.* A loop over matches that finds no
matches passes, which turns "this text must say X" into "this text must not say
not-X" -- the check evaporates exactly when someone deletes the thing it
guards.
