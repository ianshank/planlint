"""Property-based tests over the parsers (CP-PT).

Coverage floors prove the tests *execute* a line; a property proves something
is true of the line for inputs nobody thought to write down. The four parsers
here are the ones that read untrusted text out of a repository planlint does
not own, which is exactly where hand-picked examples run out: the BOM defect
this suite now guards was found by a probe, not by any of the 700+ example
tests that already existed.

Every property below states an invariant the code already claims, in its
docstring or its design:

* ``parse_makefile`` is deterministic and returns sorted, deduplicated targets
  (``MakefileFacts`` builds them as ``tuple(sorted(set(...)))``).
* ``parse_makefile`` never raises on arbitrary text -- it reads untrusted
  Makefiles, so "does not crash" is a contract, not an aspiration.
* ``strip_define_blocks`` is idempotent -- it blanks a block's lines, so a
  second pass has nothing left to find.
* The upstream parser recognises exactly the requirement headings present,
  independent of heading depth (the drift U005 exists to *report* must not
  change the count U002 works from).
* ``Criterion.is_negative`` depends on wording, not on ASCII casing or
  surrounding whitespace -- every negation pattern is compiled with
  ``re.IGNORECASE``. (ASCII deliberately: a few Unicode letters case-map to
  more than one code point, which is Python's business, not the matcher's.)

``derandomize=True`` is deliberate. This is a merge gate, and a gate that
fails on one run in fifty gets overridden and then deleted; a fixed example
set makes a failure reproducible from the failure message alone. Fixed per
interpreter, strictly: ``st.text()`` samples from the running Python's own
Unicode tables, so 3.10 and 3.13 draw different characters -- each version
is reproducible with itself, which is what a gate needs. It trades
ongoing exploration for that, so widening the search is an explicit local
activity rather than a surprise in CI:

    pytest tests/test_properties.py --hypothesis-seed=random

A counterexample found that way should be added to the example suite as a
named regression test, the way the four documented linter faults were.
