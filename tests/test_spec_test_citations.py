"""Every `_Verified by:` test citation in this repo's own specs resolves.

This project exists to fail a build when a spec cites machinery the repository
does not have. Its own specs cite *tests* the same way, via
``_Verified by:_ `pytest -k <selector>` `` — and until this guard existed,
nothing checked those. An adversarial review found that twenty-one distinct
selectors across two change packages named tests that did not exist, several
of them asserting the test "already exists". A spec-governance tool cannot
ship with that particular lie in its own tree.

A selector resolves when at least one test *function name* defined under
``tests/`` contains it as a substring. That is deliberately narrower than what
``pytest -k`` accepts: ``-k`` matches against the whole node id, so a real
selector could also match a module name, a class, or a parametrised case id.
This guard would reject such a selector as unresolved.

The narrowing is the useful direction. Every citation in this repository names
a test function, that is the convention worth enforcing, and a guard that also
accepted module and parameter names could be satisfied by a selector matching
nothing a reader would recognise as the cited test. A false rejection here
costs one rewritten citation; a false acceptance costs the property the guard
exists for. If a citation ever legitimately needs a parametrised case id, widen
this deliberately rather than loosening it to full node ids.

Names are read from the AST rather than by running pytest once per selector,
which keeps the whole guard well under a second.
