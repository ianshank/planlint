"""SARIF 2.1.0 output, the composite action, and the pre-commit hooks file.

`AC-SA-1..19`. The format's value is placement: the same findings `validate`
already prints, delivered onto the diff in the pull request a team already
reviews rather than into a CI log nobody opens. So the properties worth
guarding are the ones that decide whether an annotation lands on the right
line of the right file — and the ones that decide whether a finding survives
the trip at all.

Two of those are less obvious than they look:

- A finding with ``line == 0`` (no locus, or an unmigrated check) omits the
  SARIF region rather than clamping to 1. Rules that hold a real locus now
  copy it onto ``Finding.line`` via ``CheckHit``; inventing line 1 would
  still annotate the wrong content.
- A finding with no path must still be emitted. Dropping it would lose a real
  result to make a schema happy, which is the one failure this format must
  not introduce.
