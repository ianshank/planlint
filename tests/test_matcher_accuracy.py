"""Hold the prose matchers to measured accuracy floors (CP-MA).

G002 and U004/S003 are the two rules that read English rather than structure,
and both have already shipped a defect of exactly that kind. Coverage proves
their code runs; a fixture proves each rule *can* fire. Neither says how often
either fires on the wrong sentence, which for G002 is the number that decides
whether the rule works at all: it asks only whether a spec carries **at least
one** non-success criterion, so one false positive anywhere switches it off.

The floors live in ``pyproject.toml`` under ``[tool.specgraph]`` -- never in
the Makefile or a workflow, which is this project's own rule G003 applied to
itself and enforced by ``tools/check_no_hardcoded_thresholds.py``.

Scoring lives in ``tools/matcher_accuracy.py`` so the gate and the
human-readable report can never disagree about what was measured.
