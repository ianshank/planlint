"""Guards every prose claim about the rule registry's count or per-family id
ranges against ``rules.RULES`` itself -- the real source of truth.

Added by CP-AD after the third independent recurrence of the same drift
class in this codebase's history (``docs/architecture/c4.md`` twice, then
``rules.py``'s own module docstring): a single test, not a new tool or
Makefile target, per ``fix-adopter-artifact-drift``'s own pre-authorized
"cheapest form" once recurrence is demonstrated (DEC-AD-006).

``CHANGELOG.md`` is deliberately excluded -- its dated entries are historical
record, correct when written; a changelog is supposed to diverge from the
live count over time, and guarding it would fight its own purpose.

Pure: reads ``rules.RULES`` and doc files as plain text, no CLI/subprocess
needed (mirrors ``test_dialect_card.py``'s style).
