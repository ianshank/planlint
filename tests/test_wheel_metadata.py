"""The wheel-metadata gate catches what it claims to — `AC-LM-3`.

Why these tests are not "build the real wheel and look at it". The obvious
fail-closed criterion for the PEP 639 migration was "a build with no LICENSE
file fails". It does not: setuptools accepts a ``license-files`` glob matching
nothing and emits a wheel with no licence, silently. So the gate reads the
artifact instead — and a gate is only worth having if something proves it
rejects a bad artifact. These build synthetic wheels in-memory, one per
violation, which is both faster and stricter than hoping a real build happens
to be broken in the right way.

A single end-to-end test at the bottom runs the gate against the wheel this
repository actually produces, so the synthetic fixtures can never drift into
testing a shape setuptools no longer emits.
