"""Tests for machinery.py -- the structural Makefile parser (CP-3).

One fixture per behavior, matching this project's existing per-rule-fixture
testing style. The non-execution test (AC-MP-2) is the most important test
in this file -- it is the only thing standing between this module and a
real safety regression, so treat it as load-bearing, not boilerplate.
