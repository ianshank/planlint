"""Milestone 5: corpus validation for the speckit dialect.

No live network access to pull real `spec-kit`-CLI-generated output in this
environment, so this hand-authors several representative fixtures spanning
the format variance SpecKit's own documented template allows (multiple
prioritized user stories, multi-line Given/When/Then, an in-progress draft
still carrying [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers) and runs the full rule set
against each -- the same discipline this repo already applies to
`good_harness.md`/`good_upstream.md`.

Finding from this pass: the original single-line-only `GWT_SCENARIO` missed
a realistic multi-line authoring style; fixed in parse_semantics.py
(see its own comment) rather than left as a known gap. No further
GWT_SCENARIO tightening identified beyond that -- S004 stays at WARN
(R-SK-27) since this remains a hand-authored, not live-collected, corpus.

    A shopper completes checkout and receives a confirmation.

    **Why this priority**: The core transaction the feature exists for.

    **Acceptance Scenarios**:

    1. **Given** a shopper with items in their cart
       **When** they submit payment
       **Then** an order confirmation is shown

    ### User Story 2 - Reject an expired payment method (Priority: P2)

    **Acceptance Scenarios**:

    1. **Given** a shopper whose card has expired, **When** they submit payment, **Then** the payment is declined.

    ## Requirements *(mandatory)*

    ### Functional Requirements

    - **FR-001**: The system MUST confirm every successful order.
    - **FR-002**: The system MUST decline an expired payment method.

    ## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

    - **SC-001**: Checkout completes in under 3 seconds for 99% of orders.
