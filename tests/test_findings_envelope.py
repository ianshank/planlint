"""`validate --json` is a portable, versioned artifact — `AC-FE-1..9`.

The defect these pin: the payload carried no schema version and no tool
version, and `Finding.as_dict()` emitted an absolute, native-separator path.
Both `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and the adopter-facing `templates/spec-gate.yml`
upload that file as a build artifact produced on a runner and read elsewhere,
where `/home/runner/work/...` resolves to nothing.

That absolute path was a deliberate decision (``DEC-PS-002``) whose premise was
that no consumer compares the field across two checkouts. The shipped CI
template refutes it; ``DEC-FE-001`` supersedes it on that evidence. These tests
are the fence around the new contract.
