"""One spec on disk is discovered once, however many paths reach it.

`Path.glob()` follows a *valid* directory symlink, so a
`specs/002-alias -> specs/001-foo` link yields two distinct `Path` entries for
the same `spec.md`. Unfixed, one spec is parsed twice: `change_dirs` and
`feature_dirs` over-count, `validate`'s `specs_checked` over-reports, and
`build_graph` renders duplicate `FR-001`/`SC-001` nodes for a single
requirement — a spec graph that shows work that does not exist.

Both discovery functions are covered. The bug was found in the SpecKit path
during review of that dialect, but `find_spec_files` had the identical latent
behaviour for `openspec/changes/`, which is why the fix is one shared helper
rather than a dialect-specific patch.
