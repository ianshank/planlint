"""Deterministic validation of `.claude/agents/*.md` and
`.claude/skills/**/*.md` -- the Claude Code dev-tooling used to develop
this repo itself, not `planlint`'s own product code (see
`docs/agents-skills-harness.md`'s disambiguation note).

Mirrors `test_rule_registry_docs.py`'s own reason for existing: nothing
previously caught `.claude/skills/planlint-add-rule/SKILL.md`'s rule-family
list silently missing `rules_speckit.py` after the SpecKit dialect (a real,
found-in-review drift instance, not a hypothetical). These files are prose
read by an agent, not code exercised by the test suite -- with nothing
checking them, a stale command, a renamed test file, or a dropped rule
family drifts silently and is only caught if a human (or another agent)
happens to notice.

Pure: reads `.claude/` files and `Makefile`/`rules.py` as plain text; no
CLI/subprocess needed (mirrors `test_rule_registry_docs.py`'s own style).
No new dependency -- frontmatter is flat `key: value` pairs, parsed with a
plain line split rather than pulling in PyYAML (`dependencies = []` in
`pyproject.toml` is a load-bearing product boundary; see `docs/hooks.md`'s
"Adding a new pure derived-output module" convention, which this test
follows for its own parsing).
