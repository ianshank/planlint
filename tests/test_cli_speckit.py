"""CLI-level tests for a SpecKit-only repo -- no openspec/ ancestor at all
(add-speckit-dialect, Milestone 3).

Every rule active before Milestone 4's G002/G003 exemption lands must still
pass cleanly against this fixture, so these tests exercise a genuine exit 0,
not just "didn't hit the discovery guard": no bare percentage/threshold
(G003), at least one negative-phrased criterion (G002), and at least one
requirement/criterion recognized at all (G001).

    ### User Story 1 - Reject unattested writes (Priority: P1)

    **Acceptance Scenarios**:

    1. **Given** an unattested write, **When** validation runs, **Then** the write is rejected.

    ## Requirements *(mandatory)*

    ### Functional Requirements

    - **FR-001**: The system MUST attest every write.

    ## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

    - **SC-001**: Every write is attested before acknowledgment.
