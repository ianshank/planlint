    # Spec: Demo Capability

    > **Status:** DRAFT

    ## Problem Statement

    **Evidence:** `demo/mod.py::run` writes without attestation.

    ## Requirements

    - R-DMO-1: The system MUST attest every write.
    - C-DMO-1: The change MUST NOT weaken INV-1.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    - [ ] **AC-DMO-1:** An attested write records an evidence id. (R-DMO-1)
      _Verified by:_ `pytest -k test_attested_write` · stage: `make test`

    - [ ] **AC-DMO-2 (non-success):** An unattested write is denied and the
      error names INV-1. (C-DMO-1)
      _Verified by:_ `pytest -k test_unattested_denied` · stage: `make test`

    ## Invariants Touched

    - INV-1: preserved, proven by AC-DMO-2.

    ## Validation Matrix

    | Stage | Make Target | Pass Criteria |
    |---|---|---|
    | Focused | `make test` | AC-DMO-1..2 |
