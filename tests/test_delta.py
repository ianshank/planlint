"""`delta` reports staleness the machinery *caused* — `AC-DL-1..12`.

The property that makes this verb worth having, and the one every test here
circles: a citation must have been **supported at the baseline** and be
unsupported now. A citation that was already broken before the comparison
began belongs to `validate` (G004/G005/G008), not here. Without that
attribution, `delta` would be a second, worse `validate` — the same findings
under a different name, and a reader unable to tell which of them their own
change caused.

The headline case the roadmap names is the coverage floor: you moved it, and
these specs still cite the old number while passing every gate.
