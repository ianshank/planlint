"""End-to-end: the installed CLI over the new corpora and matcher behaviour.

The unit and corpus tests call ``detect.profile()`` and the parsers in
process. This module drives the real command the way CI and an adopter do --
``python -m openspec_graph.cli`` as a subprocess through
``tests/support.run_cli`` -- so every fix on this branch is proven at the exit
code and stdout boundary, not only at the function boundary. It is the mock
track of ``docs/aqa.md``'s two-track e2e, extended to the labelled corpora.

Each test states which shipped defect it would have caught.
