"""The distributable Agent Skill's claims, held to the CLI's real behavior.

``skills/planlint-spec-governance/SKILL.md`` tells an agent three things it
cannot verify for itself: which verbs never write, what each exit code means,
and what a given failure message looks like. Prose asserting any of those
drifts silently the moment the CLI changes -- and a skill that wrongly
promises "read-only" is not a documentation bug, it is an agent writing files
into a repository it was asked only to inspect.

Every test here pins one of those claims to the thing it claims about:
filesystem state hashed before and after, stderr compared against the exact
strings the skill quotes, manifests compared against the package's own
version. Mirrors ``tests/test_rule_registry_docs.py``'s reason for existing --
the doc is only as good as the check behind it.
