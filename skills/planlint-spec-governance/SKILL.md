# planlint spec governance

`planlint` is a deterministic linter for implementation plans. It reads a
repository's real machinery -- Makefile targets, the coverage floor's config
locator, declared invariants -- and reports where a spec's claims do not match
them. It contains no model and makes no judgement calls.

**Your job is to run it and report what it says. The exit code is the verdict.**

## Preflight

Run `planlint --version` first.

- Not found: tell the user to install it (`pip install planlint`) and stop.
  Do not install it on their behalf without being asked.
- Older than the version named in this skill's `planlint-min-version`: say so
  and stop. Older releases lack the exit-code behaviour described below.

## The two commands that do the work

```
planlint --target . detect                    # what this repo actually does
planlint --target . validate --fail-on ERROR  # the gate
```

Run `detect` first. It reports the dialect, the coverage-threshold locator,
and the make targets it found, which is the context every finding is phrased
against. For structured output use `validate --json` for findings, and
`detect --format json` for a portable, schema-versioned dialect card --
`detect --json` is a deprecated legacy shape carrying machine-specific
absolute paths, and warns as much on stderr.

Both structured outputs are portable. `validate --json` carries a
`schema_version` and the `tool_version` that produced it, its `target` is the
absolute repository root, and every finding's `path` is relative to that
target in POSIX form -- so a findings file written on a CI runner still
resolves when it is read anywhere else.

`validate --format sarif` emits the same findings as SARIF 2.1.0, for a CI job
that wants them annotated on a pull request instead of printed. `--json` is an
alias of `--format json`; passing it alongside a different format is a usage
error rather than a preference the tool resolves for you.

`report` is the one verb that reads no repository at all. Point it at a
findings envelope saved earlier by `validate --format json` -- possibly on
another machine, since that envelope is portable -- and it renders the same
run as SARIF, as GitHub workflow-command annotations, as a job-summary table,
or as CI step outputs. It never evaluates a rule and never exits 1: the gate
was decided by the run that produced the envelope, and this only says what
that run found. Pass the dialect card from `detect --format json` as well and
it also reports what the target had to be checked against -- a repository with
no make targets and no coverage floor gives the cited-stage and threshold
rules nothing to compare against, so a clean run there proves less than it
looks like it proves.

`delta --baseline CARD.json` answers a different question from `validate`:
not "is this citation broken" but "which specs did a change to this
repository's machinery leave behind" -- a make target removed, an invariant no
longer declared, a spec still citing the coverage floor that just moved.
A citation that was already broken before the baseline is `validate`'s
finding, not a delta. The baseline is a card saved earlier by
`detect --format json`, so the verb needs one to have been kept.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No findings at or above the threshold | Report the pass. |
| 1 | Findings at or above `--fail-on` | List them verbatim. This is a real failure. |
| 2 | Precondition or usage error | Not a spec failure. See below. |

Exit 2 is the one most likely to be misread. It means the command could not
run, not that the specs are bad. The three cases you will actually hit:

- **No spec tree.** `validate` and `waivers` print `no openspec/ directory and
  no SpecKit specs/ tree; run ``planlint init`` first`. `graph` prints a longer
  form naming both absolute paths. In all three cases the correct report is
  "planlint does not apply to this repository yet". You may offer
  `planlint init --dry-run` to show what scaffolding would be created. Run
  `init` itself only if the user asks for it.
- **Unknown change package.** `no specs found for change 'name'` means the
  `--change` value does not match a directory. Check the name; do not scaffold.
- **Bad target path.** A `--target` that is not a directory exits 2 with
  `ERROR target is not a directory: <path>`.

A nonzero exit is never overridden by your own reading of the spec. If you
believe a rule has misfired, say so, quote the finding, and leave the run
failed. Do not report a pass that the tool did not report.

## Verbs, and which ones write

Read-only. Safe to run at any time, on any repository:

| Verb | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `detect` | Stack, dialect, threshold locator, make targets |
| `validate` | The rule engine; the gate |
| `graph` | Spec dependency graph, as JSON or Mermaid |
| `rules` | The rule table this build carries |
| `waivers` | Every waived rule across the tree |
| `delta` | Specs whose citations went stale since a saved dialect card |
| `report` | Render a saved findings envelope as SARIF or a GitHub CI surface |

Writes files. Do not run these unless the user asks:

| Verb | Writes |
|---|---|
| `init` | Two files: a config snapshot and a project document under `openspec/` |
| `new` | Three files: a proposal, tasks, and a spec for one change package |
| `witness` | One record under the target's own hidden witness store |

`init` and `new` both accept `--dry-run`, which prints the plan and writes
nothing. Prefer it. Neither overwrites an existing file unless `--force` is
passed. **Never pass `--force`.**

`new --dialect` accepts only the harness and upstream dialects. A repository
using the SpecKit dialect can be validated but not scaffolded; say so rather
than producing a package in the wrong shape.

## Repairing a failing spec

You may edit an existing spec to resolve a finding, then re-run `validate` and
report the new exit code. That is the intended loop.

You must not make a finding disappear without changing the fact behind it.
Specifically, never:

- Add a waiver comment. A waiver is a claim that must justify itself, the
  reason text is the user's to write, and the engine rejects a reason-less
  waiver anyway. If a waiver is genuinely right, propose it and let the user
  approve the wording.
- Run `witness`. A witness records that continuous integration really ran a
  stage. Recording one yourself asserts something you did not observe.
- Edit the coverage floor, or any threshold the spec is measured against.
- Rename or add a Makefile target so that a citation resolves. Fix the
  citation in the spec instead.
- Delete a spec, or regenerate one over the top of an existing file.
- Write spec prose from nothing. This tool evaluates plans; it does not author
  them.

## Witness mode

The witness rules are not evaluated by a plain `validate` run. They apply only
when `--require-witness` is passed, and their absence from a normal run is by
design, not a gap. Do not describe a passing `validate` as proof that any
stage actually executed.

## What it does to the repository

Nothing, for the read-only verbs above. `planlint` never runs `make` and never
evaluates the target repository's own file contents as code. It makes exactly
one subprocess call, a read-only `git rev-parse HEAD`, used to check whether a
recorded witness matches the current commit; every failure of that call is
treated as "unknown" rather than as an error.

## Wiring it into CI

`assets/spec-gate.yml` is a ready workflow. Copy it into the target
repository's own workflows directory. It calls this project's composite
action, pinned to an exact release tag, which installs the CLI, runs the gate
once, annotates the pull request, writes a job summary, and uploads the
complete evidence bundle as a workflow artifact.

The action distinguishes four results, and only the first is green: the specs
passed; findings reached the threshold; nothing was checked, so the run gated
nothing; or the scan could not run at all. Report whichever one it gives you.
A repository that has just run `init` and written no change package yet lands
on the third, which is a red build on purpose -- an empty gate is not a
passing gate.
