# planlint spec governance

`planlint` is a deterministic linter for implementation plans. It reads a
repository's real machinery -- Makefile targets, the coverage floor's config
locator, declared invariants -- and reports where a spec's claims do not match
them. It contains no model and makes no judgement calls.

**Your job is to run it and report what it says. The exit code is the verdict.**

## Preflight

Run `planlint --version` first.

- Not found: tell the user to install it (`pip install planlint`) and stop.
  Do not install it on their behalf without being asked.
- Older than the version named in this skill's `planlint-min-version`: say so
  and stop. Older releases lack the exit-code behaviour described below.

## The two commands that do the work

```
planlint --target . detect                    # what this repo actually does
planlint --target . validate --fail-on ERROR  # the gate
```

Run `detect` first. It reports the dialect, the coverage-threshold locator,
and the make targets it found, which is the context every finding is phrased
against. For structured output use `validate --json` for findings, and
`detect --format json` for a portable, schema-versioned dialect card --
`detect --json` is a deprecated legacy shape carrying machine-specific
absolute paths, and warns as much on stderr.

Both structured outputs are portable. `validate --json` carries a
`schema_version` and the `tool_version` that produced it, its `target` is the
absolute repository root, and every finding's `path` is relative to that
target in POSIX form -- so a findings file written on a CI runner still
resolves when it is read anywhere else.

`validate --format sarif` emits the same findings as SARIF 2.1.0, for a CI job
that wants them annotated on a pull request instead of printed. `--json` is an
alias of `--format json`; passing it alongside a different format is a usage
error rather than a preference the tool resolves for you.

`report --findings FILE --format {sarif,github-annotations,github-summary,github-outputs}`
projects a findings envelope saved earlier by `validate --format json`. It
prints to stdout only and never writes a file. `report --format sarif` over
that envelope is byte-identical to `validate --format sarif` on the same tree
and build. A dialect card is not an envelope and is refused.

`delta --baseline CARD.json` answers a different question from `validate`:
not "is this citation broken" but "which specs did a change to this
repository's machinery leave behind" -- a make target removed, an invariant no
longer declared, a spec still citing the coverage floor that just moved.
A citation that was already broken before the baseline is `validate`'s
finding, not a delta. The baseline is a card saved earlier by
`detect --format json`, so the verb needs one to have been kept.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No findings at or above the threshold | Report the pass. |
| 1 | Findings at or above `--fail-on` | List them verbatim. This is a real failure. |
| 2 | Precondition or usage error | Not a spec failure. See below. |

Exit 2 is the one most likely to be misread. It means the command could not
run, not that the specs are bad. The three cases you will actually hit:

- **No spec tree.** `validate` and `waivers` print `no openspec/ directory and
  no SpecKit specs/ tree; run ``planlint init`` first`. `graph` prints a longer
  form naming both absolute paths. In all three cases the correct report is
  "planlint does not apply to this repository yet". You may offer
  `planlint init --dry-run` to show what scaffolding would be created. Run
  `init` itself only if the user asks for it.
- **Unknown change package.** `no specs found for change 'name'` means the
  `--change` value does not match a directory. Check the name; do not scaffold.
- **Bad target path.** A `--target` that is not a directory exits 2 with
  `ERROR target is not a directory: <path>`.

A nonzero exit is never overridden by your own reading of the spec. If you
believe a rule has misfired, say so, quote the finding, and leave the run
failed. Do not report a pass that the tool did not report.

## Verbs, and which ones write

Read-only. Safe to run at any time, on any repository:

| Verb | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `detect` | Stack, dialect, threshold locator, make targets |
| `validate` | The rule engine; the gate |
| `graph` | Spec dependency graph, as JSON or Mermaid |
| `rules` | The rule table this build carries |
| `waivers` | Every waived rule across the tree |
| `delta` | Specs whose citations went stale since a saved dialect card |
| `report` | Project a saved findings envelope into SARIF or GitHub surfaces |

Writes files. Do not run these unless the user asks:

| Verb | Writes |
|---|---|
| `init` | Two files: a config snapshot and a project document under `openspec/` |
| `new` | Three files: a proposal, tasks, and a spec for one change package |
| `witness` | One record under the target's own hidden witness store |

`init` and `new` both accept `--dry-run`, which prints the plan and writes
nothing. Prefer it. Neither overwrites an existing file unless `--force` is
passed. **Never pass `--force`.**

`new --dialect` accepts only the harness and upstream dialects. A repository
using the SpecKit dialect can be validated but not scaffolded; say so rather
than producing a package in the wrong shape.

## Repairing a failing spec

You may edit an existing spec to resolve a finding, then re-run `validate` and
report the new exit code. That is the intended loop.

You must not make a finding disappear without changing the fact behind it.
Specifically, never:

- Add a waiver comment. A waiver is a claim that must justify itself, the
  reason text is the user's to write, and the engine rejects a reason-less
  waiver anyway. If a waiver is genuinely right, propose it and let the user
  approve the wording.
- Run `witness`. A witness records that continuous integration really ran a
  stage. Recording one yourself asserts something you did not observe.
- Edit the coverage floor, or any threshold the spec is measured against.
- Rename or add a Makefile target so that a citation resolves. Fix the
  citation in the spec instead.
- Delete a spec, or regenerate one over the top of an existing file.
- Write spec prose from nothing. This tool evaluates plans; it does not author
  them.

## Witness mode

The witness rules are not evaluated by a plain `validate` run. They apply only
when `--require-witness` is passed, and their absence from a normal run is by
design, not a gap. Do not describe a passing `validate` as proof that any
stage actually executed.

## What it does to the repository

Nothing, for the read-only verbs above. `planlint` never runs `make` and never
evaluates the target repository's own file contents as code. It makes exactly
one subprocess call, a read-only `git rev-parse HEAD`, used to check whether a
recorded witness matches the current commit; every failure of that call is
treated as "unknown" rather than as an error.

## Wiring it into CI

`assets/spec-gate.yml` is a ready workflow: it checks out with
`persist-credentials: false` and runs the composite action
`ianshank/planlint/.github/actions/planlint` pinned to an exact tag. Copy it
into the target repository's own workflows directory. Do not use a floating
major tag.
