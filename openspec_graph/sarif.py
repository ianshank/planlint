"""SARIF 2.1.0 projection of a validate run (CP-6).

A pure projection, like ``mermaid.py``: it is handed the findings
``cmd_validate`` already computed and reshapes them. It never evaluates a rule,
which is what makes "the same findings as ``--json``, no divergence" true by
construction rather than by a second implementation somebody has to keep in
step.

The point of the format is placement, not content. Findings reach an adopter
today as text in a CI log that nobody opens; SARIF puts the same findings
inline on the diff, in the pull request their team already reviews.

Stdlib-only, no I/O, and **zero intra-package imports** -- the same posture
``mermaid.py`` holds, and for the same reason: a projection that reaches back
into the package is one refactor away from depending on evaluation order. It
is handed the finding dicts ``cmd_validate`` has already serialized, which is
also what makes "the same findings as ``--json``" literally true: both
renderings read the same list of dicts, not two traversals that have to be
kept in step.

    ``rule_table`` is the whole registry, not only the rules that fired.
    GitHub attaches alert metadata by ``ruleId`` against the driver's rule
    set, so a rule firing for the first time in a later run would otherwise
    arrive with no name or description. It also keeps the driver block a
    function of the build rather than of the target repository, which is what
