"""Parse an OpenSpec spec document into a dialect-neutral structure.

Both supported dialects reduce to the same shape: a set of normative
requirements, a set of verifiable criteria, and the external references
(make targets, invariant IDs) the document claims.

Decomposed into focused modules; this file is the facade:

- :mod:`parse_semantics` — compiled grammar (both dialects), negative-criterion
  and hard-threshold detectors, heading-drift constants, waiver parser.
- :mod:`parse_model` — ``Criterion``/``Requirement``/``ParsedSpec`` dataclasses.
- :mod:`parse_harness` — harness-dialect parser (R-/C- lists + ACs).
- :mod:`parse_upstream` — upstream-dialect parser (Requirement/Scenario headings).

Public surface (``parse_spec``, ``scenario_has_gwt``, ``ParsedSpec``,
``Criterion``, ``Requirement``, ``Waiver``, and the compiled ``MAKE_REF``) is
re-exported here so existing ``from openspec_graph.parse import ...`` imports
keep working (R-DG-1).

    Translation of ``OSError`` at the one place specs are read, so every

    "this repo's specs have findings" (exit 1). Letting the raw ``OSError``
    escape produced a traceback and exit 1 -- the code the contract reserves
    for findings -- so a CI job could not tell a broken mount from a failing
    gate. Same defect class as DEC-SD-001 (``init``/``new`` on an unwritable
    target), one verb further in; ``detect.py`` already handled its own reads
    this way (``_threshold``/``_invariants``/``_adrs``).

    Carries the offending ``path`` and the underlying ``reason`` so callers
    render one line without re-deriving either from the message text.

    The exception's own ``str()`` is deliberately terse and *not* the
    operator-facing wording: that lives once, in ``cli._UNREADABLE_SPEC``
    (R-RE-6). A second copy here would be a copy that differs -- this one has
    only the absolute path, which the CLI renders root-relative -- and the
    Agent Skill's exit-code reference quotes the CLI's version verbatim.
