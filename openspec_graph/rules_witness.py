"""Witness-mode rules: W001-W002 (CP-WM).

Evaluated only when ``--require-witness`` is passed to ``validate`` --
neither rule's ``check`` gates itself (it can't see the flag); the gate is
``cli.cmd_validate`` choosing ``rules.RULES`` vs. ``rules.NON_WITNESS_RULES``
before calling ``rules.evaluate()`` (``DEC-WM-007``). The same
``NON_WITNESS_RULES`` constant is what excludes both rules from
``graph.py``'s output entirely (``DEC-WM-013``).

Both apply to every dialect (``DEC-WM-005``): ``Criterion.verified_by``
already carries a backtick-fenced `` `make X` `` citation for harness (the
``_Verified by:_`` line) and upstream (the whole Scenario block) alike,
exactly like ``graph.py::_stages_cited()`` already relies on. A criterion
citing more than one stage (e.g. a GWT scenario mentioning both
`` `make build` `` and `` `make test` ``) requires a witness for every
citation -- no heuristic picks "the real one" (``DEC-WM-016``).
