"""Rule engine. Each rule turns a prose convention into a mechanical check.

Decomposed into focused modules; this file is the facade/registry:

- :mod:`rule_types` — ``Finding``/``Rule`` dataclasses, severity constants.
- :mod:`rules_generic` — universal rules G001-G009.
- :mod:`rules_harness` — harness-dialect rules H001-H006.
- :mod:`rules_upstream` — upstream-dialect rules U001-U005.
- :mod:`rules_speckit` — speckit-dialect rules S001-S004.
- :mod:`rules_witness` — witness-mode rules W001-W002, evaluated only under
  ``--require-witness`` (``NON_WITNESS_RULES``/``evaluate(rule_set=...)``).

Public surface (``Finding``, ``Rule``, ``CheckHit``, ``evaluate``,
``rule_table``, ``RULES``, ``NON_WITNESS_RULES``, ``ERROR``/``WARN``/``INFO``)
is re-exported here so existing ``from openspec_graph.rules import ...``
imports keep working (R-DG-1).

Severity contract:
  ERROR -- blocks the gate. The document makes an unverifiable or false claim.
  WARN  -- degrades review quality but does not make the document wrong.
  INFO  -- observation, never blocks.

    witness mode (every pre-CP-WM call site, most of this project's own

    also evaluate W001/W002 -- the mechanism ``cmd_validate``'s
    ``--require-witness`` gate uses (``DEC-WM-007``). A spec may waive a
    rule with an inline ``<!-- specgraph:allow G003 reason -->`` comment.
    Waivers are downgraded to INFO rather than dropped, so a suppression
    stays visible in the report and in CI logs. G007 is exempt
