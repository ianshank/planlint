# --- non-success detection (G002) ------------------------------------------
#
# A non-success criterion is one that asserts something is refused, fails, or
# does not happen. Detected by pattern rather than by an exact-phrase list,
# because the phrasings that matter in practice are open-ended -- "opens no
# egress channel" and "mutates neither the remote nor the local tag list" both
# describe failure paths and neither is a fixed idiom.
#
# The patterns are tiered, and the tier is the design rather than a label. An
# earlier flat list of bare lexical triggers (`zero`, `block`, `fail`,
# `without`) scored precision 0.38 / recall 0.42 against a hand-labelled set of
# 86 criterion sentences -- worse than useless for a rule whose failure mode is
# *silence*: G002 asks only whether a spec has at least ONE non-success
# criterion, so a single false positive anywhere in the document switches the
# rule off. "The block renders below the header" used to satisfy it. Measured
# again after this tiering and a second adversarial round: precision 0.92,
# recall 0.98.
#
#   annotation -- the author said so. Harness-dialect criteria carry a
#                 parenthesised marker ("**AC-WM-3 (non-success):**"), which is
#                 an explicit declaration, not prose to be interpreted. Matched
#                 against the WHOLE marker (a full match, not a search), so a
#                 criterion merely discussing negative numbers is not promoted
#                 by the word -- and neither is an upstream scenario, whose
#                 `Criterion.note` is the entire scenario block rather than a
#                 marker (an adversarial review found the bare-word false
#                 positive had simply moved dialects when this tier matched by
#                 search).
#   structural -- grammar that means absence or refusal wherever it appears
#                 ("cannot", "no X is created", "writes no", "exits 2"). Every
#                 pattern in this tier scored zero false positives.
#   lexical    -- a word whose *verb* forms mean failure but whose noun forms
#                 are ordinary software vocabulary. Each is restricted to the
#                 inflections that are actually verbal, and refuses a following
#                 hyphen, which is what separates "the write is denied" from
#                 "denied-list entries", "the run fails" from "--cov-fail-under",
#                 and "the request is blocked" from "blocking I/O".
#
# `tools/matcher_accuracy.py` scores this table against
# `tests/fixtures/phrasing/`; `tests/test_matcher_accuracy.py` holds it to the
# floors declared in `pyproject.toml`. Adding a pattern here without moving
# those numbers is the point: the table is data, and its accuracy is a tracked
# figure rather than a claim.

    comparing, rather than a loose prefix match, so "Success Criteria"
    still doesn't spuriously match an unrelated "Success Metrics" heading.

    starts with ``-`` or ``|``. A threshold written in a prose paragraph, in a
    heading, or on a trailing ``_Verified by:_`` line is invisible to G003.

    That is a deliberate limit, not an oversight. Criteria live in bullets and
    tables, and widening the scan to running prose reintroduces exactly the
    false-positive class ``fix-prose-matcher-precision`` was spent lowering --
    a narrative "we raised it from 80% to 90%" is a description, not a
    hard-coded gate. The cost is real and is recorded rather than hidden: a
    genuine offender phrased as prose is missed, and G003 is silent about it.
    Widening this is a matcher change and would need the labelled-corpus and
    ``make matcher-accuracy`` treatment the prose matchers get, not a looser
    ``startswith``. Pinned by ``test_hard_coded_reads_bullets_and_table_rows_only``.

    ``dialect == "speckit"`` exempts the ``Success Criteria`` section body
    from the scan (R-SK-19, mandatory fix): a conventional, purely
    positive-phrased SpecKit Success Criterion like ``SC-001: 95% of new
    users complete onboarding in under 5 minutes`` is a completely
    legitimate bare-percentage bullet, not a hard-coded value that should

    intent this check exists to enforce for harness/upstream. Uses
    :func:`speckit_section_body`, not :func:`section_body`, to find the
    span -- the canonical SpecKit template's heading is
    ``## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*``, and an exact-title lookup would
    silently find nothing against it, defeating this exemption entirely
    against real SpecKit output. Blanks the section span rather than
    skipping it structurally, preserving length (and therefore line
    numbers), the same technique ``strip_waiver_comments()`` uses for the
