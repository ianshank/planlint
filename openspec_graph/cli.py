"""`planlint` — the CI gate that fails when a spec cites a gate this repo does
not have.

Pointed at a cloned repository, `planlint` reads the target's real machinery
(make targets, coverage floor, invariant source, spec dialect) and holds every
spec to that, using the target's own vocabulary. It is a linter under
`openspec validate`, not an authoring framework.

Verbs:
  detect    read-only report of the target's stack, gates, threshold, dialect
  init      write openspec/specgraph.json + project.md, a snapshot of detected conventions
  new       scaffold a change package in the target's own dialect
  validate  run the rule engine over every change package (text, JSON, or SARIF)
  graph     emit the spec dependency graph as JSON or Mermaid (pure projection of validate)
  rules     print the rule table
  waivers   list every waived rule across the tree, with file, line, reason, change
  delta     list specs whose citations went stale since a saved dialect card
  report    project a findings envelope into SARIF or GitHub surfaces
  witness   record proof a stage actually ran (CI-side; see validate --require-witness)

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings at or above the fail level, 2 usage error.
