    symlink -- is skipped so the next name still gets its turn. Resolving to an

    This deliberately diverges from GNU Make, which aborts rather than falling
    through. planlint reads untrusted foreign repositories and never executes

    An **empty but readable** candidate is not skipped. A zero-byte
    `GNUmakefile` genuinely declares no rules, so reporting no targets matches
    what `make` would do -- hence the test below is ``is None``, never
    falsiness, which would wrongly treat "" as "not found" and fall through.

    On a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS by default) `makefile` matches a

    the name on disk. Harmless and deliberately not normalised: both resolve to

    ``Path.glob()`` follows a *valid* directory symlink, so a
    ``specs/002-alias -> specs/001-foo`` link yields two distinct ``Path``
    entries for the same ``spec.md``. Unfixed, that one spec is parsed twice:
    ``change_dirs``/``feature_dirs`` over-count, ``validate``'s
    ``specs_checked`` over-reports, and ``build_graph`` renders duplicate
    ``FR-001``/``SC-001`` nodes for a single requirement.

    Identity is ``Path.resolve()``, not content: two genuinely separate files
    with identical text are two specs and both must be linted.

    The survivor is the path that *is* its own real path — the real directory,
    not an alias pointing at it. Keeping the first entry in sorted order
    instead would be deterministic but arbitrary, and measurably wrong: with
    ``changes/alias -> changes/real``, "alias" sorts first, so the real
    package became unaddressable by its own name (``--change real`` reported
    "no specs found" while ``--change alias`` passed). Whichever name a
    reviewer would recognise has to be the one that survives.

    Ordering still decides between two aliases that both point elsewhere, so
    the result stays stable across runs for any input.

    A candidate whose real path cannot be determined keeps its logical path
    instead of being dropped. Discovery never silently loses a spec; whether
    it can actually be read is the read guard's decision downstream
    (``parse.SpecReadError``), and a spec that vanished here would pass a gate
    that never saw it.
