"""Structurally parse Makefile text without ever invoking `make`.

Pure, stdlib-only, no I/O of its own -- detect.py reads the Makefile and
hands the text in as a string. R-MP-2 (non-negotiable, DEC-MP-001): this
module MUST NEVER import or call subprocess, os.system, or any process-
execution mechanism, at any confidence level. GNU Make evaluates
``$(shell ...)`` calls outside a recipe body at parse/read time,
unconditionally -- so shelling out to a real `make` to inspect an untrusted
target repo's Makefile is unsafe under any flag combination. Safety here is
structural (the parser only ever does str.splitlines()/str.split()/re
operations on the text it is given), not a runtime guard -- see
tests/test_machinery.py's non-execution test and
tests/test_decomposition.py's static import guard.
