# PostToolUse(Edit|Write): nudge after editing a rules module or a
# threshold-bearing config file -- this exact drift class (doc locations
# falling out of sync with rules.RULES; a hard-coded threshold creeping into
# Makefile/CI YAML) has recurred multiple times in this repo's own history
# (see tests/test_rule_registry_docs.py's docstring, tools/check_no_hardcoded_thresholds.py).
# "decision": "block" here is PostToolUse's contract for surfacing `reason`
# to Claude prominently -- it does NOT undo the edit (PostToolUse fires
# after the write already landed, so there is nothing left to prevent). It
# is a strong reminder, not an actual block, despite the JSON key's name.
#
# No jq dependency: not guaranteed to be on PATH (confirmed absent in at
# least one real dev environment this repo is used from). file_path is
# extracted with grep/sed and the response JSON is hand-emitted -- safe here
# since every reason string below is plain text with no embedded double
# quotes or backslashes.

# (a Windows path's "\\" doubled to "\\\\") or already single-backslash;
# collapse both forms to "/" so a forward-slash-only glob still matches.
FILE_NORM=$(printf '%s' "$FILE" | sed 's/\\\\/\//g; s/\\/\//g')
# Matched below as "/$FILE_NORM" so a repo-relative path (skills/x/SKILL.md)
