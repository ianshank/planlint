# pytest-cov's own --cov-fail-under is disabled on the one run in
# `coverage-run`: its total is the diluted figure for everything measured,
# and the scoped checkers under `test` and `coverage-tools` are the gate --
# they read the real floors from pyproject.toml, which is where rule G003
# says a threshold belongs. Spelled as a variable rather than a literal
# because a bare 0 in a recipe is indistinguishable, to
# `tools/check_no_hardcoded_thresholds.py`, from the pinned floor that guard
# exists to reject.

coverage-run: ## Run the suite once, measuring both trees into coverage.json (no floor of its own; test and coverage-tools read it scoped)
	@# Erase first: [tool.coverage.run] parallel = true means coverage COMBINES
	@# every .coverage.* it finds, so data left by an ad-hoc run (another
	@# source, an interrupted run) silently merges into this one. It can raise
	@# the number as easily as lower it, and a gate that can be talked up by a
	@# stale file in the working tree is not a gate.
	@# The bare --cov measures every [tool.coverage.run] source entry; the
	@# trees are named there, never here, so adding one is a config line.

coverage-tools: coverage-run ## Coverage floors for the tools/ gate scripts themselves
	@# Depends on the one run, so a standalone `make coverage-tools` produces
	@# the report it reads and gates tools/ alone; inside `pre-pr` Make builds
	@# `coverage-run` once and both this target and `test` read that report.
	@# The floors come from [tool.specgraph] tools_*_fail_under via the same two
	@# checkers, under --scope -- separate keys because tools/ is a different
	@# tree with a different reading, and one combined number would let either
	@# hide behind the other's headroom.

	python tools/check_branch_coverage.py coverage.json --scope tools

coverage-per-file: coverage-run ## Report every module below [tool.specgraph] per_file_line_min line coverage — a report, not a gate
	@# Depends on the run and not on `test`, so the list can be read while a
	@# floor is red (DEC-MCO-009). Composed into neither `ci` nor `pre-pr`.
